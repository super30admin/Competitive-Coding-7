# Solution

# // Time Complexity : Min Heap Approach: O(KLOGN) where N is the number of rows
#                      Binary Search Approach: O(NLOG(MAX-MIN)) where N is to find the count of numbers less than 
#                      mid(and find next range to be used) and LOG(MAX-MIN) gives the time complexity for Binary Search. Where
#                      MAX is the maximum element(matrix[n-1][n-1]) of matrix and MIN is the minimum element of matrix(matrix[0][0])
# // Space Complexity : Min Heap Approach: O(N)
#                       Binary Search Approach: O(1)
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : None


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Minheap Approach: We can consider each row of matrix as a list. So we will have N Lists. Now we can use approach similar to
# two pointer when we are trying to merge two sorted arrays. Only thing is, we use min heap as data structure which can hold
# pointers for each list. So we add first elements of each list into min heap. Now we pop the min out and add the next element of
# that list. If we do this K times, the Kth element which gets popped will be the Kth smallest element.
# Binary Search Approach: We can take first element of matrix as "low" and last element of matrix as "high", since these elements
# are the smallest and largest in the entire matrix. Now we can find mid between these two values. And check the number of
# elements in matrix which are smaller than or equal to the mid.
# To find count of smaller or equal elements: We should start from the bottom row and first column. If we find a value smaller than
# mid that means all other values above and including that in that column will be less than mid. So if "i" is the row number then
# we can add i+1 to count(since i is 0 index approach). Once we find this, we can increment the column to check if the value is
# smaller again or not. If smaller again add the count else, decrement the row till you find a value smaller. If found again
# increment the column and do this till we cover all the elements smaller than mid. While doing this, we also need to find the
# minimum(we can call it MIN) from the elements larger than mid and maximum(we can call it MAX) from the elements smaller than mid.
#  This will be used to set the new range between which we will have to find the kth smallest element again. MIN will be used as
# "high" if count > k so that we can reduce the scope, MAX will be used as "low" if count<k so that we can increase the scope
# to find the right mid. If count == mid then we will have the kth smallest element in MAX, if low<high breaks then low will have
# the result
