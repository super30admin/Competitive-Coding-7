# Solution

# // Time Complexity : O(NLOGN) since we are sorting the input
# // Space Complexity : O(N) since the heap/priority queue size might be equal to input length
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes 
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : None


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Approach is to sort the input. Now add end time of each list into min heap, before adding check if the start time of new
# list is before the end time of min element in heap. If start time is smaller than end time then
# add new end time, else pop old end time and add new end time.
# Take size of queue to find number of rooms
# Basically consider heap/priorirty queue as number of rooms, as you keep adding end time of each meeting into queue, you will
# will be able to figure out when the next meeting will be over. So when you are trying to start a meeting you check if there is
# a meeting getting over before you start new one. Since min heap, least end time will be on the top
